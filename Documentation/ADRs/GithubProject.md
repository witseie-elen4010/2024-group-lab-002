## Context

The purpose of this tool is to plan the project to subdivide it into sprints. Each sprint contains a number of user stories.
This tool can follow and monitor the progress of the project automatically. User stories are in the form of  
issues on Github. Each user story is closed by a pull request of branches upon their completion.
Sprints are in the form of milestones in Github. The reliability of this tool is guaranteed because it includes details such as
the time stamp of each change. Moreover, Git forms part of the system of each of the contributor's computers.

Additionally, SCRUM is implemented using Github Project to create the team's scrumboard.
