# ADR 2: Use Creately for User Story Mapping
Date: 22 May 2024

Status
Proposed

## Context
We are developing a multiplayer game where players take turns writing descriptions and drawing pictures. The game involves complex logic and workflows, and we need a way to visualize these elements for better understanding and collaboration among the team.

User Story Mapping is a visual representation of the process a user goes through when interacting with a product or service1. It helps create a better user experience by identifying and defining changes needed to improve1.

Creately is a visual collaboration and diagramming platform that offers a User Story Mapping tool[1]. It allows us to map user stories to user journey steps, tame our agile development backlog with easy visual tools[1]. It also provides advanced grouping and frames to organize multiple user stories into functional groups to plan releases[1].

## Decision
We will use Creately’s User Story Mapping tool as our primary tool for creating user story maps. This will help us to better understand the game logic, player interactions, and error handling mechanisms. It will also facilitate collaboration among team members and stakeholders.

## Consequences
By using Creately’s User Story Mapping tool, we expect to achieve the following outcomes:

Improved understanding of the game logic and workflows.
Better understanding of user requirements.
Enhanced collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
Streamlined documentation process with the ability to easily create and update user story maps.
Reduced time spent on explaining complex workflows and game logic.
